# Data-Structures-Project
This project was implemented during the course of data structures.

The first part of this project was the implementation of three sorting algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort and Bubble Sort) 
and two search algorithms (Binary Search and Binary Interpolation Search). 
The algorithms were run for worst case input, best case input and average case input.
The second part, was to carry out a 2-3-4 tree, where the data are in the leaves.
The following functions were performed for this tree (empty(), contains(x), insert(x), delete(x), numberOfNodes(), toIntArray() ).
This project created using c++ programming language.
